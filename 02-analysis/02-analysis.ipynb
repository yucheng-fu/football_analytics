    "# Modelling pass difficulties\n",
    "We can all agree that Pavard's half volley goal was a stunner, but I think the buildup to the goal is also really interesting to look into. Matuidi plays a through ball to Lucas Hern√°ndez who then plays a cross at a difficult angle back to Pavard, before he hits a half volley. While the half volley itself requires lots of technique (and luck), I want to answer the following about the passes:\n",
    "1. Is there a way to quantify the difficulty of the two passes that lead up the goal?\n",
    "2. If yes, which pass was more difficult to make?"

    "Fortunately, there are lots of data related to passes in the ``statsbombpy`` API which we can leverage to adopt a data-driven approach to answer our questions. The plan is to build a model that can tell us give us a pass difficulty score $p_{pass}$ for a pass from point $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$ on the pitch. Before diving into building the model, let us discuss some assumptions and their limitations:"
